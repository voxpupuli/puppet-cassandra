# An optional class that will allow a suitable repository to be configured
# from which packages for Apache Cassandra can be downloaded.  Changing
# the defaults will allow any Debian Apt repository to be configured.
# Currently Apache only provide a Debian repository
# (http://cassandra.apache.org/download/) mentions of Yum are for wishful
# thinking.
# @param descr [string] On the Red Hat family, this is passed as the `descr`
#   attribute to a `yumrepo` resource.  On the Debian family, it is passed as
#   the `comment` attribute to an `apt::source` resource.
# @param key_id [string] On the Debian family, this is passed as the `id`
#   attribute to an `apt::key` resource.  On the Red Hat family, it is
#   ignored.
# @param key_url [string] On the Debian family, this is passed as the
#   `source` attribute to an `apt::key` resource.  On the Red Hat family,
#   it is ignored.
# @param pkg_url [string] If left as the default, this will set the `baseurl`
#   to 'http://rpm.datastax.com/community' on a `yumrepo` resource
#   on the Red Hat family.  On the Debian family, leaving this as the default
#   will set the `location` attribute on an `apt::source` to
#   'http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian'.
# @param release [string] On the Debian family, this is passed as the `release`
#   attribute to an `apt::source` resource.  On the Red Hat family, it is
#   ignored.
