* Fixed a problem that was showing the status of the module build as an
  error since the release of the fog-google gem version 0.1.1.

## 2015-10-01 - Release 1.7.0 ([diff](https://github.com/locp/cassandra/compare/1.6.0...1.7.0))

### Summary

* Corrected a bug in how commitlog_sync has handled by Cassandra.
* Some non-functional improvements
* Additional features for the cassandra::datastax_repo class.

### Features

* Added the commitlog_segment_size_in_mb attribute to the cassandra class.
* Added the following fields to the cassandra::datastax_repo class:

  * descr
  * key_id
  * key_url
  * pkg_url
  * release

  This should make the configuring of repositories more flexible.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug in how the commitlog_sync and the attributes that are
  associated with it are handled

### Improvements

The following non-functional improvements were implemented:

* Added tags to the module metadata.
* Migrated the acceptance tests from Vagrant to Docker.  The associated
  improvements to performance means that more rigorous acceptance tests can
  be applied in a shorter time.  For the first time as well, they are
  visible on Travis.

non-functional improvements in the automated unit tests.

### Features

* The JAVA_HOME can now be set for the datastax_agent (see the
  cassandra::datastax_agent => java_home attribute).
* The file mode for the directories can now be specified for the
  commitlog_directory, data_file_directories and the saved_caches_directory
  in the cassandra class.

### Improvements

* Uncovered resources in the unit testing are now tested.

## 2015-09-15 - Release 1.4.1 ([diff](https://github.com/locp/cassandra/compare/1.4.0...1.4.1))

### Summary

This release fixes a minor bug (possibly better described as a typing mistake)
and makes some non-functional improvements.  It also allows the user to
override the default behaviour of failing on a non-supported operating system.

### Features

* A new flag called `fail_on_non_suppoted_os` has been added to the
  `cassandra` class and can be set to **false** so that an attempt can be
  made to use this module on an operating system that is not in the Debian
  or Red Hat families.

### Bugfixes

* Changed the default value for the `package_name` of the
  `cassandra::optutils` class from `'undef'` to *undef*.

### Improvements

* Clarified the expectations of submitted contributions.
* Unit test improvements.
